# Danny-Ma-8Weeks-SQL-Challenge

This repository contains the solutions to the case studies in [8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) created by Danny Ma

Each case-study folder contains the following files

- A local database file
- SQL file to create the schema, tables and loading data
- A python file to create, connect and load the sql file into the db
- A readme file explaining the problem statement, ERD, and case study questions
- A jupyter notebook which contains SQL queries answering the respective challenge questions

PS; I used various SQL dialect and db throughout each case study to challenge myself. The dialect and db used will be documented in the readme of each case study.
